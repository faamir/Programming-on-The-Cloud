NEGATIVE:
I have been looking forward to seeing this movie for a couple months after seeing the preview at another movie. Now I just feel like we wasted our money. All of the funny parts were shown in the trailer, and the rest was just a mess. It didn't make any sense to me. It seemed as if Tyler Perry just had a bunch of different things he wanted to put in a movie so he just threw them all together in this. I'm so upset. Tiffany Haddish seems like she is genuinely funny but in this movie she was just over the top for no legitimate reason. Whoopi Goldberg was stoned in all of her 4 appearances in the movie. And the main character honestly wasn't even interesting, just rude and judgmental. The entire movie was just a waste of my time and my money.

If you saw the trailer you pretty much saw the whole movie in condensed time. Speaking of which this movie was 30 minutes to long. I'm not a prude but, I couldn't believe this was a Tyler Perry movie! It just seemed way to steamy to be one of his moves. I guess people change. I thought this would be funny cause Tiffany was in it but nope it was aweful. Save your money and watch it when it comes on tv. The Danica's character is just an awful person and Whoopi brought NOTHING to her role. Horrible movie! Watching paint dry would have had a better storyline.


POSITIVE:
This movie was HILARIOUS!!!!! Laugh out loud, fall on the floor funny! I really think Tyler should stay in the Rated R lane. This is where he belongs. WHOOPIE GOLDBERG was even HILARIOUS! The Trailer Park scene was an unexpected treat as well. Also, don't forget to stay for the outtakes!

Huge Tyler Perry fans and knew this would be steamier than his other works but it was well done and worked well with the story he was telling. The theater was full and the laughter was non-stop. Huge Tiffany Haddish fans and she did not disappoint, great ensemble cast and if you are looking for a good laugh this movie will do it!!!
