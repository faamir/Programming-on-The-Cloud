if pyspark does not work just do in gcloud shell:
delete all files which you uploaded in storage
check for personal files in the home directory:
ls -a $HOME
sudo rm -rf $HOME
in 3 dots above: Restart

if FlaskLSTM does not work for LSTM, just run LSTM and save lest_sent.h5 in gcloud in case keras versions are different
